How to Play:

Use your keyboard arrow keys to navigate the player through the maze to
find the correct answer to the questions. If you get stuck, find one of the clues in 
the maze to give you a hint. There are multiple questions per level. Once you finish
all the questions of one level, you may proceed to the next. There are three different 
levels: Easy (True/False), Medium (Multiple Choice), and Hard (Fill in the Blank).
