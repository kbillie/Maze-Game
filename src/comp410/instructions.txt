How to Play:

Use your keyboard arrow keys to navigate the player through the maze so that 
they can select the correct answer. If you get stuck, click on the clue button
to get a hint. There are multiple questions per level. Once you finish all the 
questions of one level, you may proceed to the next. There are three different 
levels: Easy (True/False), Medium (Multiple Choice), and Hard (Fill in the Blank).
